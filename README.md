# JavaChat
This is one of my homework for Advanced Computer Programming I took in sophomore year.
In this homework, we learned about implementing Networking in Java. We created both the server side and client side of a simple chat.

### This program includes:
- Server and Client sides in the terminal
- Client side in a Java Applet
- IP Address must be used to connect to the server.
- Notification for everyone if someone enters or exits.
